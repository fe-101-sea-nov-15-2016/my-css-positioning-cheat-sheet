# my-css-positioning-cheat-sheet

Boilerplate for creating a CSS positioning cheat sheet

## Purpose

- What you should end up with is a styled document that you can reference
  quickly for lookup some CSS positioning

## Instructions

- Since you are already an HTML master, I've already helped you out by
  creating some content.

- You should take a note of what you are getting for free.
  - 4 rows created by 4 sequential div elements
  - 4 boxes within each row
    - all boxes get the same styling because they share the class "box"
    - all boxes get their shape by the height and width settings
    - the boxes are laid out next to each other because of the
      display property, which is set to inline-block
      - inline-block basically tells the browser to render the blocks inline
        while retaining their block characteristics, such as height and
        width
    - the boxes have some borders to separate them from each other
